// 2 problems to add "addEL" to "Delete" button:
	
	1st: Delete button is in the scipt in JS code
	2nd:querySelector give only one button
		need to hve "querySelectorAll"
 
We have put HTML that we have generated on the page..
Delete buton is not on the page

so , we have to pi=ut the Delete button on the page by putting it down the HTMl element. Like this:

--------------------------------------

document.querySelectorAll('.delete-listener')
  .forEach((deletebutton,index)=>{
    deletebutton.addEventListener('click',()=>{
      todolist.splice(index,1);
      renderTodoList();
    });
  });

to summarizzeee-------------

	*We used "querySelectorAll" to get all a list of 		all delete buttons on the page.
	**We looped through the list using "forEach" 
	**and for each "deleteButton(parameter) we added an 		EventLsitner and ran the same code to 			splice od the values from the list.
